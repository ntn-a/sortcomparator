There is no lake at Camp Green Lake  There once was a very large lake here  the largest lake in Texas  That was over a hundred years ago  Now it is just a dry  flat wasteland  There used to be a town of Green Lake as well  The town shriveled and dried up along with the lake  and the people who lived there  During the summer the daytime temperature hovers around ninety five degrees in the shade  if you can find any shade  There's not much shade in a big dry lake  The only trees are two old oaks on the eastern edge of the  lake   A hammock is stretched between the two trees  and a log cabin stands behind that  The campers are forbidden to lie in the hammock  It belongs to the Warden  The Warden owns the shade  Out on the lake  rattlesnakes and scorpions find shade under rocks and in the holes dug by the campers  Here's a good rule to remember about rattlesnakes and scorpions  If you don't bother them  they won't bother you  Usually  Being bitten by a scorpion or even a rattlesnake is not the worst thing that can happen to you  You won't die  Usually  Sometimes a camper will try to be bitten by a scorpion  or even a small rattlesnake  Then he will get to spend a day or two recovering in his tent  instead of having to dig a hole out on the lake But you don't want to be bitten by a yellow spotted lizard  That's the worst thing that can happen to you  You will die a slow and painful death  Always  If you get bitten by a yellow spotted lizard  you might as well go into the shade of the oak trees and lie in the hammock  There is nothing anyone can do to you anymore  2 The reader is probably asking  Why would anyone go to Camp Green Lake  Most campers weren't given a choice  Camp Green Lake is a camp for bad boys  If you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun  it will turn him into a good boy  That was what some people thought  3 Stanley Yelnats was given a choice  The judge said   You may go to jail  or you may go to Camp Green Lake   Stanley was from a poor family  He had never been to camp before  3 Stanley Yelnats was the only passenger on the bus  not counting the driver or the guard The guard sat next to the driver with his seat turned around facing Stanley A rifle lay across his lap Stanley was sitting about ten rows back  handcuffed to his armrest His backpack lay on the seat next to him It contained his toothbrush  toothpaste  and a box of stationery his mother had given him He'd promised to write to her at least once a week  He looked out the window  although there wasn't much to see  mostly fields of hay and cotton  He was on a long bus ride to nowhere The bus wasn't air conditioned  and the hot  heavy air was almost as stifling as the handcuffs  Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while  just like rich kids do  When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals  and pretend the animals were at camp  Camp Fun and Games he called it  Sometimes he'd have them play soccer with a marble  Other times they'd run an obstacle course  or go bungee jumping off a table  tied to broken rubber bands  Now Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games Maybe he'd make some friends  he thought  At least he'd get to swim in the lake  He didn't have any friends at home  He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size  Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realizing it  On his last day of school  his math teacher  Mrs Bell  taught ratios  As an example  she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid m the class  and had them weigh themselves  Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy Mrs  Bell wrote the ratio on the board  3 1  unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them  Stanley was arrested later that day  He looked at the guard who sat slumped in his seat and wondered if he had fallen asleep  The guard was wearing sunglasses  so Stanley couldn't see his eyes  Stanley was not a bad kid  He was innocent of the crime for which he was convicted He'd just been in the wrong place at the wrong time  It was all because of his no good dirty rotten pig stealing great great grandfather  He smiled  It was a family joke  Whenever anything went wrong  they always blamed Stanley's no good dirty rotten pig stealing great great grandfather  Supposedly  he had a great great grandfather who had stolen a pig from a one legged Gypsy  and she put a curse on him and all his descendants  Stanley and his parents didn't believe in curses  of course  but whenever anything went wrong  it felt good to be able to blame someone Things went wrong a lot  They always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time  4 He looked out the window at the vast emptiness  He watched the rise and fall of a telephone wire  In his mind he could hear his father's gruff voice softly singing to him  If only  if only   the woodpecker sighs   The bark on the tree was just a little bit softer   While the wolf waits below  hungry and lonely  He cries to the moo  oo  oon   If only  if only   It was a song his father used to sing to him  The melody was sweet and sad  but Stanley's favorite part was when his father would howl the word  moon   The bus hit a small bump and the guard sat up  instantly alert  Stanley's father was an inventor  To be a successful inventor you need three things  intelligence  perseverance  and just a little bit of luck  Stanley's father was smart and had a lot of perseverance  Once he started a project he would work on it for years  often going days without sleep  He just never had any luck  Every time an experiment failed  Stanley could hear him cursing his dirty rotten pig stealing great grandfather  Stanley's father was also named Stanley Yelnats  Stanley's father's full name was Stanley Yelnats III  Our Stanley is Stanley Yelnats IV  Everyone in his family had always liked the fact that  Stanley Yelnats  was spelled the same frontward and backward  So they kept naming their sons Stanley  Stanley was an only child  as was every other Stanley Yelnats before him  All of them had something else in common  Despite their awful luck  they always remained hopeful  As Stanley's father liked to say   I learn from failure   But perhaps that was part of the curse as well  If Stanley and his father weren't always hopeful  then it wouldn't hurt so much every time their hopes were crushed   Not every Stanley Yelnats has been a failure   Stanley's mother often pointed out  whenever Stanley or his father became so discouraged that they actually started to believe in the curse  The first Stanley Yelnats  Stanley's great grandfather  had made a fortune m the stock market   He couldn't have been too unlucky   At such times she neglected to mention the bad luck that befell the first Stanley Yelnats  He lost his entire fortune when he was moving from New York to California  His stagecoach was robbed by the outlaw Kissin' Kate Barlow  If it weren't for that  Stanley's family would now be living in a mansion on a beach in California  Instead  they were crammed in a tiny apartment that smelled of burning rubber and foot odor  If only  if only       The apartment smelled the way it did because Stanley's father was trying to invent a way to recycle old sneakers   The first person who finds a use for old sneakers   he said   will be a very rich man   It was this latest project that led to Stanley's arrest  The bus ride became increasingly bumpy because the road was no longer paved  5 Actually  Stanley had been impressed when he first found out that his great grandfather was robbed by Kissin' Kate Barlow  True  he would have preferred living on the beach in California  but it was still kind of cool to have someone in your family robbed by a famous outlaw  Kate Barlow didn't actually kiss Stanley's great grandfather  That would have been really cool  but she only kissed the men she killed  Instead  she robbed him and left him stranded in the middle of the desert   He was lucky to have survived   Stanley's mother was quick to point out  The bus was slowing down  The guard grunted as he stretched his arms   Welcome to Camp Green Lake   said the driver  Stanley looked out the dirty window  He couldn't see a lake  And hardly anything was green  4 Stanley felt somewhat dazed as the guard unlocked his handcuffs and led him off the bus  He'd been on the bus for over eight hours   Be careful   the bus driver said as Stanley walked down the steps  Stanley wasn't sure if the bus driver meant for him to be careful going down the steps  or if he was telling him to be careful at Camp Green Lake   Thanks for the ride   he said  His mouth was dry and his throat hurt  He stepped onto the hard  dry dirt  There was a band of sweat around his wrist where the handcuff had been  The land was barren and desolate  He could see a few rundown buildings and some tents  Farther away there was a cabin beneath two tall trees  Those two trees were the only plant life he could see  There weren't even weeds  The guard led Stanley to a small building  A sign on front said  YOU ARE ENTERING CAMP GREEN LAKE JUVENILE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY  Next to it was another sign which declared that it was a violation of the Texas Penal Code to bring guns  explosives  weapons  drugs  or alcohol onto the premises  As Stanley read the sign he couldn't help but think  Well  duh  The guard led Stanley into the building  where he felt the welcome relief of air conditioning  A man was sitting with his feet up on a desk  He turned his head when Stanley and the guard entered  but otherwise didn't move  Even though he was inside  he wore sunglasses and a cowboy hat  He also held a can of soda  and the sight of it made Stanley even more aware of his own thirst  He waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign   That's a lot of sunflower seeds   the bus guard said Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the desk   I quit smoking last month   said the man in the cowboy hat  He had a tattoo of a rattlesnake on his arm  and as he signed his name  the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle  I used to smoke a pack a day  Now I eat a sack of these every week   6 The guard laughed  There must have been a small refrigerator behind his desk  because the man in the cowboy hat produced two more cans of soda  For a second Stanley hoped that one might be for him  but the man gave one to the guard and said the other was for the driver   Nine hours here  and now nine hours back   the guard grumbled   What a day   Stanley thought about the long  miserable bus ride and felt a little sorry for the guard and the bus driver  The man in the cowboy hat spit sunflower seed shells into a wastepaper basket  Then he walked around the desk to Stanley   My name is Mr  Sir   he said  Whenever you speak to me you must call me by my name  is that clear   Stanley hesitated   Uh  yes  Mr  Sir   he said  though he couldn't imagine that was really the man's name   You're not in the Girl Scouts anymore   Mr  Sir said  Stanley had to remove his clothes in front of Mr  Sir  who made sure he wasn't hiding anything  He was then given two sets of clothes and a towel  Each set consisted of a long sleeve orange jumpsuit  an orange T shirt  and yellow socks  Stanley wasn't sure if the socks had been yellow originally  He was also given white sneakers  an orange cap  and a canteen made of heavy plastic  which unfortunately was empty  The cap had a piece of cloth sewn on the back of it  for neck protection  Stanley got dressed  The clothes smelled like soap  Mr  Sir told him he should wear one set to work in and one set for relaxation  Laundry was done every three days  On that day his work clothes would be washed  Then the other set would become his work clothes  and he would get clean clothes to wear while resting   You are to dig one hole each day  including Saturdays and Sundays  Each hole must be five feet deep  and five feet across in every direction  Your shovel is your measuring stick  Breakfast is served at 4 30   Stanley must have looked surprised  because Mr  Sir went on to explain that they started early to avoid the hottest part of the day   No one is going to baby sit you   he added   The longer it takes you to dig  the longer you will be out in the sun  If you dig up anything interesting  you are to report it to me or any other counselor  When you finish  the rest of the day is yours   Stanley nodded to show he understood   This isn't a Girl Scout camp   said Mr  Sir  He checked Stanley's backpack and allowed him to keep it  Then he led Stanley outside into the blazing heat   Take a good look around you   Mr  Sir said   What do you see   Stanley looked out across the vast wasteland  The air seemed thick with heat and dirt   Not much   he said  then hastily added   Mr  Sir   Mr  Sir laughed   You see any guard towers    No   7  How about an electric fence    No  Mr  Sir    There's no fence at all  is there    No  Mr  Sir    You want to run away   Mr  Sir asked him  Stanley looked back at him  unsure what he meant   If you want to run away  go ahead  start running  I'm not going to stop you   Stanley didn't know what kind of game Mr  Sir was playing   I see you're looking at my gun  Don't worry  I'm not going to shoot you   He tapped his holster   This is for yellow spotted lizards  I wouldn't waste a bullet on you    I'm not going to run away   Stanley said   Good thinking   said Mr  Sir   Nobody runs away from here  We don't need a fence  Know why  Because we've got the only water for a hundred miles  You want to run away  You'll be buzzard food in three days   Stanley could see some kids dressed in orange and carrying shovels dragging themselves toward the tents   You thirsty   asked Mr  Sir   Yes  Mr  Sir   Stanley said gratefully   Well  you better get used to it  You're going to be thirsty for the next eighteen months   5 There were six large gray tents  and each one had a black letter on it  A  B  C  D  E  or F  The first five tents were for the campers  The counselors slept in F  Stanley was assigned to D tent  Mr  Pendanski was his counselor   My name is easy to remember   said Mr  Pendanski as he shook hands with Stanley just outside the tent   Three easy words  pen  dance  key   Mr  Sir returned to the office  Mr  Pendanski was younger than Mr  Sir  and not nearly as scary looking  The top of his head was shaved so close it was almost bald  but his face was covered in a thick curly black beard  His nose was badly sunburned   Mr  Sir isn't really so bad   said Mr  Pendanski   He's just been in a bad mood ever since he quit smoking  The person you've got to worry about is the Warden  There's really only one rule at Camp Green Lake  Don't upset the Warden   Stanley nodded  as if he understood   I want you to know  Stanley  that I respect you   Mr  Pendanski said   I understand you've made some bad mistakes in your life  Otherwise you wouldn't be here  But everyone makes mistakes  You may have done some bad things  but that doesn't mean you're a bad kid   Stanley nodded  It seemed pointless to try and tell his counselor that he was innocent  He figured that everyone probably said that  He didn't want Mr  Pen dance key to think he had a bad attitude  8  I'm going to help you turn your life around   said his counselor   But you're going to have to help  too  Can I count on your help    Yes  sir   Stanley said  Mr  Pendanski said   Good   and patted Stanley on the back  Two boys  each carrying a shovel  were coming across the compound  Mr  Pendanski called to them   Rex  Alan  I want you to come say hello to Stanley  He's the newest member of our team   The boys glanced wearily at Stanley  They were dripping with sweat  and their faces were so dirty that it took Stanley a moment to notice that one kid was white and the other black   What happened to Barf Bag   asked the black kid   Lewis is still in the hospital   said Mr  Pendanski   He won't be returning   He told the boys to come shake Stanley's hand and introduce themselves   like gentlemen    Hi   the white kid grunted   That's Alan   said Mr  Pendanski   My name's not Alan   the boy said   It's Squid  And that's X Ray    Hey   said X Ray  He smiled and shook Stanley's hand  He wore glasses  but they were so dirty that Stanley wondered how he could see out of them  Mr  Pendanski told Alan to go to the Rec Hall and bring the other boys to meet Stanley  Then he led him inside the tent  There were seven cots  each one less than two feet from the one next to it   Which was Lewis's cot   Mr  Pendanski asked   Barf Bag slept here   said X Ray  kicking at one of the beds   All right  Stanley  that'll be yours   said Mr  Pendanski  Stanley looked at the cot and nodded  He wasn't particularly thrilled about sleeping in the same cot that had been used by somebody named Barf Bag  Seven crates were stacked in two piles at one side of the tent  The open end of the crates faced outward  Stanley put his backpack  change of clothes  and towel in what used to be Barf Bag's crate  It was at the bottom of the stack that had three in it  Squid returned with four other boys  The first three were introduced by Mr  Pendanski as Jose  Theodore  and Ricky  They called themselves Magnet  Armpit  and Zigzag   They all have nicknames   explained Mr  Pendanski   However  I prefer to use the names their parents gave them  the names that society will recognize them by when they return to become useful and hardworking members of society    It ain't just a nickname   X Ray told Mr  Pendanski  He tapped the rim of his glasses   I can see inside you  Mom  You've got a big fat heart   The last boy either didn't have a real name or else he didn't have a nickname  Both Mr  Pendanski and X Ray called him Zero   You know why his name's Zero   asked Mr  Pendanski   Because there's nothing inside his head   He smiled and playfully shook Zero's shoulder  Zero said nothing   And that's Mom   a boy said  9 Mr  Pendanski smiled at him   If it makes you feel better to call me Mom  Theodore  go ahead and call me Mom   He turned to Stanley   If you have questions  Theodore will help you  You got that  Theodore  I'm depending on you   Theodore spit a thin line of saliva between his teeth  causing some of the other boys to complain about the need to keep their  home  sanitary   You were all new here once   said Mr  Pendanski   and you all know what it feels like  I'm counting on every one of you to help Stanley   Stanley looked at the ground  Mr  Pendanski left the tent  and soon the other boys began to file out as well  taking their towels and change of clothes with them  Stanley was relieved to be left alone  but he was so thirsty he felt as if he would die if he didn't get something to drink soon   Hey  uh  Theodore   he said  going after him   Do you know where I can fill my canteen   Theodore whirled and grabbed Stanley by his collar   My name's not Thee o dore   he said   It's Armpit   He threw Stanley to the ground  Stanley stared up at him  terrified   There's a water spigot on the wall of the shower stall    Thanks       Armpit   said Stanley  As he watched the boy turn and walk away  he couldn't for the life of him figure out why anyone would want to be called Armpit  In a way  it made him feel a little better about having to sleep in a cot that had been used by somebody named Barf Bag  Maybe it was a term of respect  6 Stanley took a shower  if you could call it that  ate dinner  if you could call it that  and went to bed  if you could call his smelly and scratchy cot a bed  Because of the scarcity of water  each camper was only allowed a four minute shower  It took Stanley nearly that long to get used to the cold water  There was no knob for hot water  He kept stepping into  then jumping back from  the spray  until the water shut off automatically  He never managed to use his bar of soap  which was just as well  because he wouldn't have had time to rinse off the suds  Dinner was some kind of stewed meat and vegetables  The meat was brown and the vegetables had once been green  Everything tasted pretty much the same  He ate it all  and used his slice of white bread to mop up the juice  Stanley had never been one to leave food on his plate  no matter how it tasted   What'd you do   one of the campers asked him  At first Stanley didn't know what he meant   They sent you here for a reason    Oh   he realized   I stole a pair of sneakers   The other boys thought that was funny  Stanley wasn't sure why  Maybe because their crimes were a lot worse than stealing shoes   From a store  or were they on someone's feet   asked Squid  10  Uh  neither   Stanley answered   They belonged to Clyde Livingston   Nobody believed him   Sweet Feet   said X Ray   Yeah  right    No way   said Squid  Now  as Stanley lay on his cot  he thought it was kind of funny in a way  Nobody had believed him when he said he was innocent  Now  when he said he stole them  nobody believed him either  Clyde  Sweet Feet  Livingston was a famous baseball player  He'd led the American League in stolen bases over the last three years  He was also the only player in history to ever hit four triples in one game  Stanley had a poster of him hanging on the wall of his bedroom  He used to have the poster anyway  He didn't know where it was now  It had been taken by the police and was used as evidence of his guilt in the courtroom  Clyde Livingston also came to court  In spite of everything  when Stanley found out that Sweet Feet was going to be there  he was actually excited about the prospect of meeting his hero  Clyde Livingston testified that they were his sneakers and that he had donated them to help raise money for the homeless shelter  He said he couldn't imagine what kind of horrible person would steal from homeless children  That was the worst part for Stanley  His hero thought he was a no good dirty rotten thief  As Stanley tried to turn over on his cot  he was afraid it was going to collapse under all his weight  He barely fit in it  When he finally managed to roll over on his stomach  the smell was so bad that he had to turn over again and try sleeping on his back  The cot smelled like sour milk  Though it was night  the air was still very warm  Armpit was snoring two cots away  Back at school  a bully named Derrick Dunne used to torment Stanley  The teachers never took Stanley's complaints seriously  because Derrick was so much smaller than Stanley  Some teachers even seemed to find it amusing that a little kid like Derrick could pick on someone as big as Stanley  On the day Stanley was arrested  Derrick had taken Stanley's notebook and  after a long game of come and get it  finally dropped it in the toilet in the boys' restroom  By the time Stanley retrieved it  he had missed his bus and had to walk home  It was while he was walking home  carrying his wet notebook  with the prospect of having to copy the ruined pages  that the sneakers fell from the sky   I was walking home and the sneakers fell from the sky   he had told the judge   One hit me on the head   It had hurt  too  They hadn't exactly fallen from the sky  He had just walked out from under a freeway overpass when the shoe hit him on the head  11 Stanley took it as some kind of sign  His father had been trying to figure out a way to recycle old sneakers  and suddenly a pair of sneakers fell on top of him  seemingly out of nowhere  like a gift from God  Naturally  he had no way of knowing they belonged to Clyde Livingston  In fact  the shoes were anything but sweet  Whoever had worn them had had a bad case of foot odor  Stanley couldn't help but think that there was something special about the shoes  that they would somehow provide the key to his father's invention  It was too much of a coincidence to be a mere accident  Stanley had felt like he was holding destiny's shoes  He ran  Thinking back now  he wasn't sure why he ran  Maybe he was in a hurry to bring the shoes to his father  or maybe he was trying to run away from his miserable and humiliating day at school  A patrol car pulled alongside him  A policeman asked him why he was running  Then he took the shoes and made a call on his radio  Shortly thereafter  Stanley was arrested  It turned out the sneakers had been stolen from a display at the homeless shelter  That evening rich people were going to come to the shelter and pay a hundred dollars to eat the food that the poor people ate every day for free  Clyde Livingston  who had once lived at the shelter when he was younger  was going to speak and sign autographs  His shoes would be auctioned  and it was expected that they would sell for over five thousand dollars  All the money would go to help the homeless  Because of the baseball schedule  Stanley's trial was delayed several months  His parents couldn't afford a lawyer   You don't need a lawyer   his mother had said   Just tell the truth   Stanley told the truth  but perhaps it would have been better if he had lied a little  He could have said he found the shoes in the street  No one believed they fell from the sky  It wasn't destiny  he realized  It was his no good dirty rotten pig stealing great great grandfather  The judge called Stanley's crime despicable   The shoes were valued at over five thousand dollars  It was money that would provide food and shelter for the homeless  And you stole that from them  just so you could have a souvenir   The judge said that there was an opening at Camp Green Lake  and he suggested that the discipline of the camp might improve Stanley's character  It was either that or jail  Stanley's parents asked if they could have some time to find out more about Camp Green Lake  but the judge advised them to make a quick decision   Vacancies don't last long at Camp Green Lake   7 The shovel felt heavy in Stanley's soft  fleshy hands  He tried to jam it into the earth  but the blade banged against the ground and bounced off without making a dent  The vibrations ran up the shaft of the shovel and into Stanley's wrists  making his bones rattle  12 It was still dark  The only light came from the moon and the stars  more stars than Stanley had ever seen before  It seemed he had only just gotten to sleep when Mr  Pendanski came in and woke everyone up  Using all his might  he brought the shovel back down onto the dry lake bed  The force stung his hands but made no impression on the earth  He wondered if he had a defective shovel  He glanced at Zero  about fifteen feet away  who scooped out a shovelful of dirt and dumped it on a pile that was already almost a foot tall  For breakfast they'd been served some kind of lukewarm cereal  The best part was the orange juice  They each got a pint carton  The cereal actually didn't taste too bad  but it had smelled just like his cot  Then they filled their canteens  got their shovels  and were marched out across the lake  Each group was assigned a different area  The shovels were kept in a shed near the showers  They all looked the same to Stanley  although X Ray had his own special shovel  which no one else was allowed to use  X Ray claimed it was shorter than the others  but if it was  it was only by a fraction of an inch  The shovels were five feet long  from the tip of the steel blade to the end of the wooden shaft  Stanley's hole would have to be as deep as his shovel  and he'd have to be able to lay the shovel flat across the bottom in any direction  That was why X Ray wanted the shortest shovel  The lake was so full of holes and mounds that it reminded Stanley of pictures he'd seen of the moon   If you find anything interesting or unusual   Mr  Pendanski had told him   you should report it either to me or Mr  Sir when we come around with the water truck  If the Warden likes what you found  you'll get the rest of the day off    What are we supposed to be looking for   Stanley asked him   You're not looking for anything  You're digging to build character  It's just if you find anything  the Warden would like to know about it   He glanced helplessly at his shovel  It wasn't defective  He was defective  He noticed a thin crack in the ground  He placed the point of his shovel on top of it  then jumped on the back of the blade with both feet  The shovel sank a few inches into the packed earth  He smiled  For once in his life it paid to be overweight  He leaned on the shaft and pried up his first shovelful of dirt  then dumped it off to the side  Only ten million more to go  he thought  then placed the shovel back in the crack and jumped on it again  He unearthed several shovelfuls of dirt in this manner  before it occurred to him that he was dumping his dirt within the perimeter of his hole  He laid his shovel flat on the ground and marked where the edges of his hole would be  Five feet was awfully wide  He moved the dirt he'd already dug up out past his mark  He took a drink from his canteen  Five feet would be awfully deep  too  The digging got easier after a while  The ground was hardest at the surface  where the sun had baked a crust about eight inches deep  Beneath that  the earth was looser  13 But by the time Stanley broke past the crust  a blister had formed in the middle of his right thumb  and it hurt to hold the shovel  Stanley's great great grandfather was named Elya Yelnats  He was born in Latvia  When he was fifteen years old he fell in love with Myra Menke   He didn't know he was Stanley's great great grandfather   Myra Menke was fourteen  She would turn fifteen in two months  at which time her father had decided she should be married  Elya went to her father to ask for her hand  but so did Igor Barkov  the pig farmer  Igor was fifty seven years old  He had a red nose and fat puffy cheeks   I will trade you my fattest pig for your daughter   Igor offered   And what have you got   Myra's father asked Elya   A heart full of love   said Elya   I'd rather have a fat pig   said Myra's father  Desperate  Elya went to see Madame Zeroni  an old Egyptian woman who lived on the edge of town  He had become friends with her  though she was quite a bit older than him  She was even older than Igor Barkov  The other boys of his village liked to mud wrestle  Elya preferred visiting Madame Zeroni and listening to her many stories  Madame Zeroni had dark skin and a very wide mouth  When she looked at you  her eyes seemed to expand  and you felt like she was looking right through you   Elya  what's wrong   she asked  before he even told her he was upset  She was sitting in a homemade wheelchair  She had no left foot  Her leg stopped at her ankle   I'm in love with Myra Menke   Elya confessed   But Igor Barkov has offered to trade his fattest pig for her  I can't compete with that    Good   said Madame Zeroni   You're too young to get married  You've got your whole life ahead of you    But I love Myra    Myra's head is as empty as a flowerpot    But she's beautiful    So is a flowerpot  Can she push a plow  Can she milk a goat  No  she is too delicate  Can she have an intelligent conversation  No  she is silly and foolish  Will she take care of you when you are sick  No  she is spoiled and will only want you to take care of her  So  she is beautiful  So what  Ptuui   Madame Zeroni spat on the dirt  She told Elya that he should go to America   Like my son  That's where your future lies  Not with Myra Menke   But Elya would hear none of that  He was fifteen  and all he could see was Myra's shallow beauty  Madame Zeroni hated to see Elya so forlorn  Against her better judgment  she agreed to help him   It just so happens  my sow gave birth to a litter of piglets yesterday   she said   There is one little runt whom she won't suckle  You may have him  He would die anyway   14 Madame Zeroni led Elya around the back of her house where she kept her pigs  Elya took the tiny piglet  but he didn't see what good it would do him  It wasn't much bigger than a rat   He'll grow   Madame Zeroni assured him   Do you see that mountain on the edge of the forest    Yes   said Elya   On the top of the mountain there is a stream where the water runs uphill  You must carry the piglet every day to the top of the mountain and let it drink from the stream  As it drinks  you are to sing to him   She taught Elya a special song to sing to the pig   On the day of Myra's fifteenth birthday  you should carry the pig up the mountain for the last time  Then take it directly to Myra's father  It will be fatter than any of Igor's pigs    If it is that big and fat   asked Elya   how will I be able to carry it up the mountain    The piglet is not too heavy for you now  is it   asked Madame Zeroni   Of course not   said Elya   Do you think it will be too heavy for you tomorrow    No    Every day you will carry the pig up the mountain  It will get a little bigger  but you will get a little stronger  After you give the pig to Myra's father  I want you to do one more thing for me    Anything   said Elya   I want you to carry me up the mountain  I want to drink from the stream  and I want you to sing the song to me   Elya promised he would  Madame Zeroni warned that if he failed to do this  he and his descendants would be doomed for all of eternity  At the time  Elya thought nothing of the curse  He was just a fifteen year old kid  and  eternity  didn't seem much longer than a week from Tuesday  Besides  he liked Madame Zeroni and would be glad to carry her up the mountain  He would have done it right then and there  but he wasn't yet strong enough  Stanley was still digging  His hole was about three feet deep  but only in the center  It sloped upward to the edges  The sun had only just come up over the horizon  but he already could feel its hot rays against his face  As he reached down to pick up his canteen  he felt a sudden rush of dizziness and put his hands on his knees to steady himself  For a moment he was afraid he would throw up  but the moment passed  He drank the last drop of water from his canteen  He had blisters on every one of his fingers  and one in the center of each palm  Everyone else's hole was a lot deeper than his  He couldn't actually see their holes but could tell by the size of their dirt piles  15 He saw a cloud of dust moving across the wasteland and noticed that the other boys had stopped digging and were watching it  too  The dirt cloud moved closer  and he could see that it trailed behind a red pickup truck  The truck stopped near where they were digging  and the boys lined up behind it  X Ray in front  Zero at the rear  Stanley got in line behind Zero  Mr  Sir filled each of their canteens from a tank of water in the bed of the pickup  As he took Stanley's canteen from him  he said   This isn't the Girl Scouts  is it   Stanley raised and lowered one shoulder  Mr  Sir followed Stanley back to his hole to see how he was doing   You better get with it   he said   Or else you're going to be digging in the hottest part of the day   He popped some sunflower seeds into his mouth  deftly removed the shells with his teeth  and spat them into Stanley's hole  Every day Elya carried the little piglet up the mountain and sang to it as it drank from the stream  As the pig grew fatter  Elya grew stronger  On the day of Myra's fifteenth birthday  Elya's pig weighed over fifty stones  Madame Zeroni had told him to carry the pig up the mountain on that day as well  but Elya didn't want to present himself to Myra smelling like a pig  Instead  he took a bath  It was his second bath in less than a week  Then he led the pig to Myra's  Igor Barkov was there with his pig as well   These are two of the finest pigs I've ever seen   Myra's father declared  He was also impressed with Elya  who seemed to have grown bigger and stronger in the last two months   I used to think you were a good for nothing book reader   he said   But I see now you could be an excellent mud wrestler    May I marry your daughter   Elya boldly asked   First  I must weigh the pigs   Alas  poor Elya should have carried his pig up the mountain one last time  The two pigs weighed exactly the same  Stanley's blisters had ripped open  and new blisters formed  He kept changing his grip on the shovel to try to avoid the pain  Finally  he removed his cap and held it between the shaft of his shovel and his raw hands  This helped  but digging was harder because the cap would slip and slide  The sun beat down on his unprotected head and neck  Though he tried to convince himself otherwise  he'd been aware for a while that his piles of dirt were too close to his hole  The piles were outside his five foot circle  but he could see he was going to run out of room  Still  he pretended otherwise and kept adding more dirt to the piles  piles that he would eventually have to move  The problem was that when the dirt was in the ground  it was compacted  It expanded when it was excavated  The piles were a lot bigger than his hole was deep  It was either now or later  Reluctantly  he climbed up out of his hole  and once again dug his shovel into his previously dug dirt  16 Myra's father got down on his hands and knees and closely examined each pig  tail to snout   Those are two of the finest pigs I have ever seen   he said at last   How am I to decide  I have only one daughter    Why not let Myra decide   suggested Elya   That's preposterous   exclaimed Igor  expelling saliva as he spoke   Myra is just an empty headed girl   said her father   How can she possibly decide  when I  her father  can't    She knows how she feels in her heart   said Elya  Myra's father rubbed his chin  Then he laughed and said   Why not   He slapped Elya on the back   It doesn't matter to me  A pig is a pig   He summoned his daughter  Elya blushed when Myra entered the room   Good afternoon  Myra   he said  She looked at him   You're Elya  right   she asked   Myra   said her father   Elya and Igor have each offered a pig for your hand in marriage  It doesn't matter to me  A pig is a pig  So I will let you make the choice  Whom do you wish to marry   Myra looked confused   You want me to decide    That's right  my blossom   said her father   Gee  I don't know   said Myra   Which pig weighs more    They both weigh the same   said her father   Golly   said Myra   I guess I choose Elya  No  Igor  No  Elya  No  Igor  Oh  I know  I'll think of a number between one and ten  I'll marry whoever guesses the closest number  Okay  I'm ready    Ten   guessed Igor  Elya said nothing   Elya   said Myra   What number do you guess   Elya didn't pick a number   Marry Igor   he muttered   You can keep my pig as a wedding present   The next time the water truck came it was driven by Mr  Pendanski  who also brought sack lunches  Stanley sat with his back against a pile of dirt and ate  He had a baloney sandwich  potato chips  and a large chocolate chip cookie   How you doin'   asked Magnet   Not real good   said Stanley   Well  the first hole's the hardest   Magnet said  Stanley took a long  deep breath  He couldn't afford to dawdle  He was way behind the others  and the sun just kept getting hotter  It wasn't even noon yet  But he didn't know if he had the strength to stand up  He thought about quitting  He wondered what they would do to him  What could they do to him  His clothes were soaked with sweat  In school he had learned that sweating was good for you  It was nature's way of keeping you cool  So why was he so hot  Using his shovel for support  he managed to get to his feet  17  Where are we supposed to go to the bathroom   he asked Magnet  Magnet gestured with his arms to the great expanse around them   Pick a hole  any hole   he said  Stanley staggered across the lake  almost falling over a dirt pile  Behind him he heard Magnet say   But first make sure nothing's living in it   After leaving Myra's house  Elya wandered aimlessly through the town  until he found himself down by the wharf  He sat on the edge of a pier and stared down into the cold  black water  He could not understand how Myra had trouble deciding between him and Igor  He thought she loved him  Even if she didn't love him  couldn't she see what a foul person Igor was  It was like Madame Zeroni had said  Her head was as empty as a flowerpot  Some men were gathering on another dock  and he went to see what was going on  A sign read  DECK HANDS WANTED FREE PASSAGE TO AMERICA He had no sailing experience  but the ship's captain signed him aboard  The captain could see that Elya was a ma n of great strength  Not everybody could carry a full grown pig up the side of a mountain  It wasn't until the ship had cleared the harbor and was heading out across the Atlantic that he suddenly remembered his promise to carry Madame Zeroni up the mountain  He felt terrible  He wasn't afraid of the curse  He thought that was a lot of nonsense  He felt bad because he knew Madame Zeroni had wanted to drink from the stream before she died  Zero was the smallest kid in Group D  but he was the first one to finish digging   You're finished   Stanley asked enviously  Zero said nothing  Stanley walked to Zero's hole and watched him measure it with his shovel  The top of his hole was a perfect circle  and the sides were smooth and steep  Not one dirt clod more than necessary had been removed from the earth  Zero pulled himself up to the surface  He didn't even smile  He looked down at his perfectly dug hole  spat in it  then turned and headed back to the camp compound   Zero's one weird dude   said Zigzag  Stanley would have laughed  but he didn't have the strength  Zigzag had to be the  weirdest dude  Stanley had ever seen  He had a long skinny neck  and a big round head with wild frizzy blond hair that stuck out in all directions  His head seemed to bob up and down on his neck  like it was on a spring  Armpit was the second one to finish digging  He also spat into his hole before heading back to the camp compound  One by one  Stanley watched each of the boys spit into his hole and return to the camp compound  18 Stanley kept digging  His hole was almost up to his shoulders  although it was hard to tell exactly where ground level was because his dirt piles completely surrounded the hole  The deeper he got  the harder it was to raise the dirt up and out of the hole  Once again  he realized  he was going to have to move the piles  His cap was stained with blood from his hands  He felt like he was digging his own grave  In America  Elya learned to speak English  He fell in love with a woman named Sarah Miller  She could push a plow  milk a goat  and  most important  think for herself  She and Elya often stayed up half the night talking and laughing together  Their life was not easy  Elya worked hard  but bad luck seemed to follow him everywhere  He always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time  He remembered Madame Zeroni telling him that she had a son in America  Elya was forever looking for him  He'd walk up to complete strangers and ask if they knew someone named Zeroni  or had ever heard of anyone named Zeroni  No one did  Elya wasn't sure what he'd do if he ever found Madame Zeroni's son anyway  Carry him up a mountain and sing the pig lullaby to him  After his barn was struck by lightning for the third time  he told Sarah about his broken promise to Madame Zeroni   I'm worse than a pig thief   he said   You should leave me and find someone who isn't cursed    I'm not leaving you   said Sarah   But I want you to do one thing for me    Anything   said Elya  Sarah smiled   Sing me the pig lullaby   He sang it for her  Her eyes sparkled   That's so pretty  What does it mean   Elya tried his best to translate it from Latvian into English  but it wasn't the same   It rhymes in Latvian   he told her   I could tell   said Sarah  A year later their child was born  Sarah named him Stanley because she noticed that  Stanley  was  Yelnats  spelled backward  Sarah changed the words of the pig lullaby so that they rhymed  and every night she sang it to little Stanley   If only  if only   the woodpecker sighs   The bark on the tree was as soft as the skies   While the wolf waits below  hungry and lonely  Crying to the moo  oo  oon   If only  if only   Stanley's hole was as deep as his shovel  but not quite wide enough on the bottom  He grimaced as he sliced off a chunk of dirt  then raised it up and flung it onto a pile  He laid his shovel back down on the bottom of his hole and  to his surprise  it fit  He rotated it and only had to chip off a few chunks of dirt  here and there  before it could lie flat across his hole in every direction  19 He heard the water truck approaching  and felt a strange sense of pride at being able to show Mr  Sir  or Mr  Pendanski  that he had dug his first hole  He put his hands on the rim and tried to pull himself up  He couldn't do it  His arms were too weak to lift his heavy body  He used his legs to help  but he just didn't have any strength  He was trapped in his hole  It was almost funny  but he wasn't in the mood to laugh   Stanley   he heard Mr  Pendanski call  Using his shovel  he dug two footholds in the hole wall  He climbed out to see Mr  Pendanski walking over to him   I was afraid you'd fainted   Mr  Pendanski said   You wouldn't have been the first    I'm finished   Stanley said  putting his blood spotted cap back on his head   All right   said Mr  Pendanski  raising his hand for a high five  but Stanley ignored it  He didn't have the strength  Mr  Pendanski lowered his hand and looked down at Stanley's hole   Well done   he said   You want a ride back   Stanley shook his head   I'll walk   Mr  Pendanski climbed back into the truck without filling Stanley's canteen  Stanley waited for him to drive away  then took another look at his hole  He knew it was nothing to be proud of  but he felt proud nonetheless  He sucked up his last bit of saliva and spat  8 A lot of people don't believe in curses  A lot of people don't believe in yellow spotted lizards either  but if one bites you  it doesn't make a difference whether you believe in it or not  Actually  it is kind of odd that scientists named the lizard after its yellow spots  Each lizard has exactly eleven yellow spots  but the spots are hard to see on its yellow green body  The lizard is from six to ten inches long and has big red eyes  In truth  its eyes are yellow  and it is the skin around the eyes which is red  but everyone always speaks of its red eyes  It also has black teeth and a milky white tongue  Looking at one  you would have thought that it should have been named a  red eyed  lizard  or a  black toothed  lizard  or perhaps a  white tongued  lizard  If you've ever been close enough to see the yellow spots  you are probably dead  The yellow spotted lizards like to live in holes  which offer shade from the sun and protection from predatory birds  Up to twenty lizards may live in one hole  They have strong  powerful legs  and can leap out of very deep holes to attack their prey  They eat small animals  insects  certain cactus thorns  and the shells of sunflower seeds  9 20 Stanley stood in the shower and let the cold water pour over his hot and sore body  It was four minutes of heaven  For the second day in a row he didn't use soap  He was too tired  There was no roof over the shower building  and the walls were raised up six inches off the ground except in the corners  There was no drain in the floor  The water ran out under the walls and evaporated quickly in the sun  He put on his clean set of orange clothes  He returned to his tent  put his duty clothes in his crate  got out his pen and box of stationery  and headed to the rec room  A sign on the door said WRECK ROOM  Nearly everything in the room was broken  the TV  the pinball machine  the furniture  Even the people looked broken  with their worn out bodies sprawled over the various chairs and sofas  X Ray and Armpit were playing pool  The surface of the table reminded Stanley of the surface of the lake  It was full of bumps and holes because so many people had carved their initials into the felt  There was a hole in the far wall  and an electric fan had been placed in front of it  Cheap air conditioning  At least the fan worked  As Stanley made his way across the room  he tripped over an outstretched leg   Hey  watch it   said an orange lump on a chair   You watch it   muttered Stanley  too tired to care   What'd you say   the Lump demanded   Nothin'   said Stanley  The Lump rose  He was almost as big as Stanley and a lot tougher   You said something   He poked his fat finger in Stanley's neck   What'd you say   A crowd quickly formed around them   Be cool   said X Ray  He put his hand on Stanley's shoulder   You don't want to mess with the Caveman   he warned   The Caveman's cool   said Armpit   I'm not looking for trouble   Stanley said   I'm just tired  that's all   The Lump grunted  X Ray and Armpit led Stanley over to a couch  Squid slid over to make room as Stanley sat down   Did you see the Caveman back there   X Ray asked   The Caveman's one tough dude   said Squid  and he lightly punched Stanley's arm  Stanley leaned back against the torn vinyl upholstery  Despite his shower  his body still radiated heat   I wasn't trying to start anything   he said  The last thing he wanted to do after killing himself all day on the lake was to get in a fight with a boy called the Caveman  He was glad X Ray and Armpit had come to his rescue   Well  how'd you like your first hole   asked Squid  Stanley groaned  and the other boys laughed   Well  the first hole's the hardest   said Stanley  21  No way   said X Ray   The second hole's a lot harder  You're hurting before you even get started  If you think you're sore now  just wait and see how you feel tomorrow morning  right    That's right   said Squid   Plus  the fun's gone   said X Ray   The fun   asked Stanley   Don't lie to me   said X Ray   I bet you always wanted to dig a big hole  right  Am I right   Stanley had never really thought about it before  but he knew better than to tell X Ray he wasn't right   Every kid in the world wants to dig a great big hole   said X Ray   To China  right    Right   said Stanley   See what I mean   said X Ray   That's what I'm saying  But now the fun's gone  And you still got to do it again  and again  and again    Camp Fun and Games   said Stanley   What's in the box   asked Squid  Stanley had forgotten he had brought it   Uh  paper  I was going to write a letter to my mother    Your mother   laughed Squid   She'll worry if I don't   Squid scowled  Stanley looked around the room  This was the one place in camp where the boys could enjoy themselves  and what'd they do  They wrecked it  The glass on the TV was smashed  as if someone had put his foot through it  Every table and chair seemed to be missing at least one leg  Everything leaned
