Brene Brown  The Power of Vulnerability  TedTalk So  I'll start with this  a couple years ago  an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event  And she called  and she said   I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer   And I thought   Well  what's the struggle   And she said   Well  I saw you speak  and I'm going to call you a researcher  I think  but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher  no one will come  because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant   And I was like   Okay   And she said   But the thing I liked about your talk is you're a storyteller  So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller   And of course  the academic  insecure part of me was like   You're going to call me a what   And she said   I'm going to call you a storyteller   And I was like   Why not magic pixie   I was like   Let me think about this for a second   I tried to call deep on my courage  And I thought  you know  I am a storyteller  I'm a qualitative researcher  I collect stories  that's what I do  And maybe stories are just data with a soul  And maybe I'm just a storyteller  And so I said   You know what  Why don't you just say I'm a researcher storyteller   And she went   Haha  There's no such thing   So I'm a researcher storyteller  and I'm going to talk to you today   we're talking about expanding perception   and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent  Story Starts  And this is where my story starts  When I was a young researcher  doctoral student  my first year I had a research professor who said to us   Here's the thing  if you cannot measure it  it does not exist   And I thought he was just sweet talking me  I was like   Really   and he was like   Absolutely   And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's in social work  a master's in social work  and I was getting my Ph.D  in social work  so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the  life's messy  love it   And I'm more of the   life's messy  clean it up  organize it and put it into a bento box   And so to think that I had found my way  to found a career that takes me   really  one of the big sayings in social work is   Lean into the discomfort of the work   And I'm like  knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A's  That was my mantra  So I was very excited about this  And so I thought  you know what  this is the career for me  because I am interested in some messy topics  But I want to be able to make them not messy  I want to understand them  I want to hack into these things I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see  So where I started was with connection  Because  by the time you're a social worker for 10 years  what you realize is that connection is why we're here  It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives  This is what it's all about  It doesn't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice and mental health and abuse and neglect  what we know is that connection  the ability to feel connected  is   neurobiologically that's how we're wired   it's why we're here  So I thought  you know what  I'm going to start with connection  Well  you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss  and she tells you 37 things you do really awesome  and one thing   an  opportunity for growth   And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth  right  Well  apparently this is the way my work went as well  because  when you ask people about love  they tell you about heartbreak  When you ask people about belonging  they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded  And when you ask people about connection  the stories they told me were about disconnection  So very quickly   really about six weeks into this research   I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen  And so I pulled back out of the research and thought  I need to figure out what this is  And it turned out to be shame  And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection  Is there something about me that  if other people know it or see it  that I won't be worthy of connection  The things I can tell you about it  it's universal  we all have it  The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection  No one wants to talk about it  and the less you talk about it the more you have it  What underpinned this shame  this  I'm not good enough     which we all know that feeling   I'm not blank enough  I'm not thin enough  rich enough  beautiful enough  smart enough  promoted enough   The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability  this idea of  in order for connection to happen  we have to allow ourselves to be seen  really seen  And you know how I feel about vulnerability  I hate vulnerability  And so I thought  this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick  I'm going in  I'm going to figure this stuff out  I'm going to spend a year  I'm going to totally deconstruct shame  I'm going to understand how vulnerability works  and I'm going to outsmart it  So I was ready  and I was really excited  As you know  it's not going to turn out well  You know this  So  I could tell you a lot about shame  but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time  But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to   and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned in the decade of doing this research  My one year turned into six years  thousands of stories  hundreds of long interviews  focus groups  At one point  people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories   thousands of pieces of data in six years  And I kind of got a handle on it  kind of understood  this is what shame is  this is how it works  I wrote a book  I published a theory  but something was not okay   and what it was is that  if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness   that's what this comes down to  a sense of worthiness   they have a strong sense of love and belonging   and folks who struggle for it  and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough  There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it  And that was  the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they're worthy of love and belonging  That's it  They believe they're worthy  And to me  the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we're not worthy of connection  was something that  personally and professionally  I felt like I needed to understand better  So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness  where I saw people living that way  and just looked at those  What do these people have in common  I have a slight office supply addiction  but that's another talk  So I had a manila folder  and I had a Sharpie  and I was like  what am I going to call this research  And the first words that came to my mind were whole hearted  These are whole hearted people  living from this deep sense of worthiness  So I wrote at the top of the manila folder  and I started looking at the data  In fact  I did it first in a four day very intensive data analysis  where I went back  pulled these interviews  pulled the stories  pulled the incidents  What's the theme  What's the pattern  My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing  where I'm just like writing and in my researcher mode  And so here's what I found  What they had in common was a sense of courage  And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute  Courage  the original definition of courage  when it first came into the English language   it's from the Latin word cor  meaning heart   and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart  And so these folks had  very simply  the courage to be imperfect  They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others  because  as it turns out  we can't practice compassion with other people if we can't treat ourselves kindly  And the last was they had connection  and   this was the hard part   as a result of authenticity  they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were  which you have to absolutely do that for connection  The other thing that they had in common was this  They fully embraced vulnerability  They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful  They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable  nor did they really talk about it being excruciating   as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing  They just talked about it being necessary  They talked about the willingness to say   I love you  first  the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees  the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram  They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out  They thought this was fundamental  I personally thought it was betrayal  I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research  where our job   you know  the definition of research is to control and predict  to study phenomena  for the explicit reason to control and predict  And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting  This led to a little breakdown   which actually looked more like this  And it did  I call it a breakdown  my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening  A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown  but I assure you it was a breakdown  And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist  Let me tell you something  you know who you are when you call your friends and say   I think I need to see somebody  Do you have any recommendations   Because about five of my friends were like   Wooo  I wouldn't want to be your therapist   I was like   What does that mean   And they're like   I'm just saying  you know  Don't bring your measuring stick   I was like   Okay   So I found a therapist  My first meeting with her  Diana   I brought in my list of the way the whole hearted live  and I sat down  And she said   How are you   And I said   I'm great  I'm okay   She said   What's going on   And this is a therapist who sees therapists  because we have to go to those  because their B.S  meters are good  And so I said   Here's the thing  I'm struggling   And she said   What's the struggle   And I said   Well  I have a vulnerability issue  And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness  but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy  of creativity  of belonging  of love  And I think I have a problem  and I need some help   And I said   But here's the thing  no family stuff  no childhood shit  I just need some strategies   So she goes like this  And then I said   It's bad  right   And she said   It's neither good nor bad  It just is what it is   And I said   Oh my God  this is going to suck   And it did  and it didn't  And it took about a year  And you know how there are people that  when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important  that they surrender and walk into it  A  that's not me  and B  I don't even hang out with people like that  For me  it was a yearlong street fight  It was a slugfest  Vulnerability pushed  I pushed back  I lost the fight  but probably won my life back  And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they  the whole hearted  what choices they were making  and what are we doing with vulnerability  Why do we struggle with it so much  Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability  No  So this is what I learned  We numb vulnerability   when we're waiting for the call  It was funny  I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says   How would you define vulnerability  What makes you feel vulnerable   And within an hour and a half  I had 150 responses  Because I wanted to know what's out there  Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick  and we're newly married  initiating sex with my husband  initiating sex with my wife  being turned down  asking someone out  waiting for the doctor to call back  getting laid off  laying off people   this is the world we live in  We live in a vulnerable world  And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability  And I think there's evidence   and it's not the only reason this evidence exists  but I think it's a huge cause   we are the most in debt  obese  addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S  history  The problem is   and I learned this from the research   that you cannot selectively numb emotion  You can't say  here's the bad stuff  Here's vulnerability  here's grief  here's shame  here's fear  here's disappointment  I don't want to feel these  I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin  I don't want to feel these  And I know that's knowing laughter  I hack into your lives for a living  God  You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects  our emotions  You cannot selectively numb  So when we numb those  we numb joy  we numb gratitude  we numb happiness  And then we are miserable  and we are looking for purpose and meaning  and then we feel vulnerable  so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin  And it becomes this dangerous cycle  One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb  And it doesn't just have to be addiction  The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain  Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty  I'm right  you're wrong  Shut up  That's it  Just certain  The more afraid we are  the more vulnerable we are  the more afraid we are  This is what politics looks like today  There's no discourse anymore  There's no conversation  There's just blame  You know how blame is described in the research  A way to discharge pain and discomfort  We perfect  If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this  it would be me  but it doesn't work  Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks  Which just  I hope in 100 years  people will look back and go   Wow   And we perfect  most dangerously  our children  Let me tell you what we think about children  They're hardwired for struggle when they get here  And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand  our job is not to say   Look at her  she's perfect  My job is just to keep her perfect   make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh grade   That's not our job  Our job is to look and say   You know what  You're imperfect  and you're wired for struggle  but you are worthy of love and belonging   That's our job  Show me a generation of kids raised like that  and we'll end the problems I think that we see today  We pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people  We do that in our personal lives  We do that corporate   whether it's a bailout  an oil spill  a recall   we pretend like what we're doing doesn't have a huge impact on other people  I would say to companies  this is not our first rodeo  people  We just need you to be authentic and real and say   We're sorry  We'll fix it   But there's another way  and I'll leave you with this  This is what I have found  to let ourselves be seen  deeply seen  vulnerably seen  to love with our whole hearts  even though there's no guarantee   and that's really hard  and I can tell you as a parent  that's excruciatingly difficult   to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror  when we're wondering   Can I love you this much  Can I believe in this this passionately  Can I be this fierce about this   just to be able to stop and  instead of catastrophizing what might happen  to say   I'm just so grateful  because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive   And the last  which I think is probably the most important  is to believe that we're enough  Because when we work from a place  I believe  that says   I'm enough   then we stop screaming and start listening  we're kinder and gentler to the people around us  and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves  That's all I have  Thank you  Brene Brown  The Price of Invulnerability  TEDxKC So  I'm going to start by walking you into a scene in a movie and then I want you all to tell me what happens next  Christmas Eve  Beautiful night  Light snowfall  Young family of four in the car  on the way to grandma's house for dinner  They're listening to the radio station  the one that starts playing the Christmas music like right at Halloween   Jingle Bells  comes on  The kids in the back seat go crazy  Everyone breaks into song  The camera pans in on the faces of the kids  the mom  dad  What happens next  Car crash  60  of people say  car crash   Sixty percent  Another 10  to 15  have equally fatalistic answers  but more creative  I have   The camera cuts to the oncologist  who is looking at the bad news that he's going to share the day after Christmas   I have   They get to grandmother's house  everyone is dead  a serial killer is on the loose   And I had one dude who worked in a shark attack  I did  What's interesting to me about this and I   it's an indictment  a little bit  of the media  which I wouldn't so much care about  except that I'm a vulnerability researcher  and I've spent the last 10 years studying vulnerability  and I cannot tell you how many hundreds and hundreds of stories that I've collected from people who  that is their response  not just to media  but in their real lives  How many parents I've interviewed who will say    and I'm looking at my children  and they're sleeping  and I'm on this   just right at the verge of bliss  and I picture something horrible happening   Do you know this  Yes  I get the promotion  and I get to fly up to headquarters  you know  to find out about my new job  And what's going to happen  Plane crashes  The fatalistic response is not universal  We're not all like that  But it is a symptom of an issue that is both universal and  I believe  profoundly dangerous  And that is  We are losing our tolerance for vulnerability  And in our culture  we   what do we think is synonymous with vulnerability  Weakness  You are an excellent audience  It's almost as if I trained you  It's perfect  Weakness  And I am going to talk about how that's not the case  tonight  Vulnerability is absolutely at the core of fear  and anxiety  and shame  and very difficult emotions that we all experience  But vulnerability is also the birthplace of joy  of love  of belonging  of creativity  of faith  And so it becomes very problematic when  as a culture  we lose our capacity to be vulnerable  So  this kind of fatalistic car crash is a symptom  I refer to it as  foreboding joy   One of the symptoms that we're losing our capacity for vulnerability is that joy actually becomes foreboding  Something good happens  or we're looking at someone we love  or we're thinking about something we care about  and then we become compelled to beat vulnerability to the punch  Other symptoms  Disappointment as a lifestyle  It is much easier to live disappointed than it is to feel disappointment  And so  this is the person in the afterschool movie that's   I don't want to play your stupid game because it's dumb and boring and because really maybe nobody will ask me   We sidestep getting excited about something  because we're not sure it's actually going to happen  Low grade disconnection is another symptom of vulnerability avoidance  We go through the motions  It's like low grade fever  It may not kill us  but it keeps us pretty miserable  Perfection is one of the   I call it  the 200 pound shield    How could anything go wrong if my life looks like an ad    I am going to perform  and please  and make sure everything's perfect   And perfectionism has nothing to do with striving for excellence and healthy   it's nothing to do with healthy striving  People who I interview who are absolutely accomplished  and people who strive for excellence are the biggest negotiators and compromisers that I've ever interviewed  Perfection is a tool to protect ourselves  Extremism  There is a very simple equation  Faith minus vulnerability equals extremism  Faith is the vulnerability that flows between the shores of certainty  Faith without vulnerability   spirituality is inherently vulnerable  It is believing in things we don't understand or really can't see  And last  I believe the most universal way that we are dealing with an intolerance for vulnerability in our culture  is that we numb  And I'll talk about this in a minute  Let's go to a bigger question  and that is  What is driving this intolerance for vulnerability in us  And I believe the answer is scarcity  We live in a culture that tells us that there is never enough  That we are not enough  that we are not good enough  that we are not safe enough  that we can never be certain enough  that we are not perfect enough and maybe the one that we really don't talk about  that I think is perhaps the most dangerous  is that we are not extraordinary enough  In this world  somehow  an ordinary life has become synonymous with a meaningless life  And so often we are missing what is truly important because we're on the quest for what is extraordinary  Not understanding that in our ordinary lives  in the ordinary moments of our lives  is really where we can find the most joy  One of the things that happens  I think  in our culture of scarcity is that we are constantly collecting images and messages and experiences   I think it's unconscious   I really don't think that we're aware of how many messages and images of scarcity that we collect every day  I want to tell a story about something that happened about 6 months ago  that I think really illustrates this  So  I have to catch a flight to go do a talk somewhere  and my daughter   I have a 5 year old and an 11 year old   my daughter's really struggling with a school project  I am definitely in the scarcity mode   I shouldn't be going  I'm not a good enough mom  I need to this is  I can't balance all of this   I have to go to my bank  which is inside of a grocery store  which   I don't know if that happens here  but in Texas  all the banks have moved inside the grocery stores   So  I walk up to the grocery store's sliding glass   the sliding glass doors  and there's a big Code Adam sticker  which  if you don't know what that is  it's an incredibly important program  but it's a program that says   This store and its employees are trained that when a child has gone missing or nabbed  everything in the store shuts down   So I look at that and I think   Oh God  OK  just stay focused  Brené  No one's going to nab your kids while you're away   I go and get my money  I get back in the car  I get on the freeway toward the airport  and I pass the AMBER Alert   Keep driving  Brené  keep driving   About 2 miles past the AMBER Alert there's a sign that tells me that 39 people have been killed on that specific stretch of highway  And please wear my seat belt  Then I get to the airport  and of course  I'm in line to security getting naked  and I hear   The threat code has been moved to orange   And then I go through this thing that I'm like   Oh my God  Holy crap  Is that a movement  Is it always orange   I was like  I'm going to start writing on my hand with a Sharpie   It's always orange  Ok  Orange is not   it hasn't gone bad   I'm like   What is it   OK  so I'm like   Orange  OK  it's orange  I think it was orange yesterday  Maybe something's happened and I was busy reading the AMBER Alert  then trying to find the license plate   So I get to my gate and I sit down and they're like   Do not leave unattended baggage    and I look down  and there's a bag  And I'm like   Oh my God  Wait   it's a diaper bag   And I know that mother is ten feet away  chasing her kid  and I'm like   But I saw this on Law and Order   And I'm going to board that plane and then the next thing you're going to hear is   Ching ching   That Law and Order  ching   Ding duum  And then we're going to blow up  So I get on the plane  and I'm really getting ready to start   I'm in kind of what you would call  I would say  an anxiety attack  So I'm having an anxiety attack  and the guy   I'm flying in business class  the guy comes in  he's sitting next to me  he turned out to be a supply chain manager consultant   and so he looks over  and he's like   You OK   I'm like   I'm good  yeah  What's up   And my phone rings and my son's face pops up  Well  he's 5  so that means his school is calling   Hello    Charlie's got a fever  Can you come get him   Mmm hmm  So I text my husband  I take care of it  and the guy next to me says   Really  are you OK   By this time  the cabin doors are closed  And I say   You know what  I'm good  but I'm having that thing where I can't decide whether my gut is really saying get off the flight  something's going to happen or I'm just freaking out  and I'm trying to figure out how to do something crazy enough to get off the flight  but to not end up on the  No Fly' list   And so  this   Yeah  I am super blast to fly with  So then he said   Let me get you a drink   I said   You know  I don't drink   And he goes   Xanax   And I was like   No  I don't do Xanax either    which is a shame  But  I don't  But then what I realize is  it really makes me think about my work  Because we numb vulnerability  Now had he said   Chips and queso   That would have been a completely different issue  Evidence of the numbing  We are the most addicted  we are the most medicated  obese  and in debt adult cohort in human history  We're numbing  And this doesn't even include busyness  I didn't even put the  busy  slide up  You know  when they start having  busy  recovery meetings  you know   busy  12 step meetings  they'll have to rent out football stadiums  Because we just stay so busy that the truth of our lives can't catch up  That's the plan  And so  what are the consequences of numbing vulnerability  What are the consequences of trying to beat vulnerability to the punch  Here is the consequence to numbing that I've learned  As a vulnerability researcher I spent the first 6 years of my research studying shame  empathy  and courage  and the last 4 years studying joy  authenticity  love  and belonging  And one of the things that I learned that was very startling for me personally and everyone I've ever met  is that you cannot selectively numb emotion  When we numb the dark emotion  when we numb vulnerability and fear  and the shame of not being good enough  we by default numb joy  We cannot selectively just numb the dark emotions  We have interesting research around this  We have research that shows us  in addiction studies  that an intensely positive experience is as likely to trigger relapse as an intensely negative experience  Let me tell you  if vulnerability is a sharp edge  there may be nothing sharper than joy  To let yourself soften into loving someone  into caring about something passionately   that's vulnerable  So the question becomes  How do we embrace vulnerability  And here's what I learned from the research  We practice gratitude  We stop and be thankful for what we have  I've interviewed a lot of people who have been through many horrific things  from genocide to trauma  and when you ask them what they need  they will tell you   I don't need your pity  I don't need your sympathy  When you look at your children  I need to know you're grateful  I need to know that you know what you have   So to practice gratitude  to honor what's ordinary about our lives  because that is what's truly extraordinary  We can compete with the images from the media  from the news  from the scary shows on TV  with our own images of gratitude about what's ordinary in our lives  The people we love  our kids  our family  play  our community  and nature  These are things that happen every single day that we're so busy being afraid we're missing these  So that's  I think  the biggest thing  is to be grateful for what we have  to honor what's ordinary  And last  I just want to say that   and I'm a parent and I'm a vulnerable person  too  but I really believe we want more guarantees  we want to believe we're not going to get hurt and bad things are not going to happen and they are  But there is a guarantee that no one talks about that  and that is  if we don't allow ourselves to experience joy and love we will definitely miss out on filling our reservoir with what we need when those hard things happen  And so  I'll end on the note that I'm grateful for your time tonight  and I'm grateful to be here  and I hope this is something that we can do together  because I believe in vulnerability we'll find what really gives purpose and meaning to our lives  Thank you  Brene Brown  Listening to Shame  TED Talk I'm going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk  I woke up the morning after I gave that talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life  And I actually didn't leave my house for about three days  The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch  And when I walked in  she was already at the table  I sat down  and she said   God  you look like hell   I said   Thanks  I feel really   I'm not functioning   And she said   What's going on   And I said   I just told 500 people that I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability  And that when being vulnerable emerged from my data  as absolutely essential to whole hearted living  I told these 500 people that I had a breakdown  I had a slide that said  Breakdown   At what point did I think that was a good idea   And she said   I saw your talk live streamed  It was not really you  It was a little different than what you usually do  But it was great   And I said   This can't happen  YouTube  they're putting this thing on YouTube  And we're going to be talking about 600  700 people   And she said   Well  I think it's too late   And I said   Let me ask you something   And she said   Yeah   I said   Do you remember when we were in college  really wild and kind of dumb   She said   Yeah   I said   Remember when we'd leave a really bad message on our ex boyfriend's answering machine  Then we'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape   And she goes   Uh  no   Of course  the only thing I could say at that point was   Yeah  me neither  Yeah   me neither   And I'm thinking to myself   Brené  what are you doing  Why did you bring this up  Have you lost your mind  Your sisters would be perfect for this   So I looked back up and she said   Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube   And I said   I'm just thinking about it a little bit   She said   You're like the worst vulnerability role model ever   And then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic  but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic  I said   If 500 turns into 1000  or 2000   my life is over   I had no contingency plan for four million  And my life did end when that happened  And maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learned something hard about myself  and that was that  as much as I would be frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world  there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small  staying right under the radar  But I want to talk about what I've learned  There's two things that I've learned in the last year  The first is  vulnerability is not weakness  And that myth is profoundly dangerous  Let me ask you honestly   and I'll give you this warning  I'm trained as a therapist  so I can out wait you uncomfortably   so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome   how many of you honestly  when you're thinking about doing something vulnerable or saying something vulnerable think   God  vulnerability is weakness  this is weakness   How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously  The majority of people  Now let me ask you this question  This past week at TED  how many of you  when you saw vulnerability up here  thought it was pure courage  Vulnerability is not weakness  I define vulnerability as emotional risk  exposure  uncertainty  It fuels our daily lives  And I've come to the belief   this is my 12th year doing this research   that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage   to be vulnerable  to let ourselves be seen  to be honest  One of the weird things that's happened is  after the TED explosion  I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country   everyone from schools and parent meetings to Fortune 500 companies  And so many of the calls went like this   Hey Dr  Brown  we loved your TED talk  We'd like you to come in and speak  We'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame   What would you like for me to talk about  There's three big answers  This is mostly  to be honest with you  from the business sector  innovation  creativity and change  So let me go on the record and say  vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation  creativity and change  To create is to make something that has never existed before  There's nothing more vulnerable than that  Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability  The second thing  in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage  the second thing I learned  is this  We have to talk about shame  And I'm going to be really honest with you  When I became a  vulnerability researcher  and that became the focus because of the TED talk   and I'm not kidding that   I'll give you an example  About three months ago  I was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store  About from a hundred feet away  this is what I hear   Vulnerability TED  Vulnerability TED   I'm a fifth generation Texan  Our family motto is  Lock and load   I am not a natural vulnerability researcher  So I'm like  just keep walking  she's on my six  And then I hear   Vulnerability TED   I turn around  I go   Hi   She's right here and she said   You're the shame researcher who had the breakdown   At this point  parents are  like  pulling their children close   Look away   And I'm so worn out at this point in my life  I look at her and I actually say   It was a fricking spiritual awakening   And she looks back and does this   I know   And she said   We watched your TED talk in my book club  Then we read your book and we renamed ourselves  The Breakdown Babes    And she said   Our tagline is   We're falling apart and it feels fantastic    You can only imagine what it's like for me in a faculty meeting  So when I became Vulnerability TED  like an action figure   Like Ninja Barbie  but I'm Vulnerability TED   I thought  I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind  because I spent six years studying shame before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability  And I thought  thank God  because shame is this horrible topic  no one wants to talk about it  It's the best way to shut people down on an airplane   What do you do    I study shame    Oh   And I see you  But in surviving this last year  I was reminded of a cardinal rule   not a research rule  but a moral imperative from my upbringing    you've got to dance with the one who brung ya   And I did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability  I learned about these things from studying shame  And so I want to walk you in to shame  Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul  And we're going to walk in  And the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there  It is to put on some galoshes   and walk through and find our way around  Here's why  We heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country  and I think globally  around race  right  Yes  We heard that  Yes  Cannot have that conversation without shame  Because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege  And when people start talking about privilege  they get paralyzed by shame  We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery  which is  have a checklist  You can't fix that problem without addressing shame  because when they teach those folks how to suture  they also teach them how to stitch their self worth to being all powerful  And all powerful folks don't need checklists  And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow so I didn't mess it up here  Myshkin Ingawale  I hope I did right by you  I saw the TED Fellows my first day here  And he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia  because people were dying unnecessarily  And he said   I saw this need  So you know what I did  I made it   And everybody just burst into applause  and they were like  Yes   And he said   And it didn't work  And then I made it 32 more times  and then it worked   You know what the big secret about TED is  I can't wait to tell people this  I guess I'm doing it right now  This is like the failure conference  No  it is  You know why this place is amazing  Because very few people here are afraid to fail  And no one who gets on the stage  so far that I've seen  has not failed  I've failed miserably  many times  I don't think the world understands that  because of shame  There's a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt  A lot of people refer to it as the  Man in the Arena  quote  And it goes like this   It is not the critic who counts  It is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles  The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat  But when he's in the arena  at best  he wins  and at worst  he loses  but when he fails  when he loses  he does so daring greatly   And that's what this conference  to me  is about  That's what life is about daring greatly  about being in the arena  When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door  and you think   I'm going in and I'm going to try this   shame is the gremlin who says   Uh  uh  You're not good enough  You never finished that MBA  Your wife left you  I know your dad really wasn't in Luxembourg  he was in Sing Sing  I know those things that happened to you growing up  I know you don't think that you're pretty enough  or smart enough  or talented enough or powerful enough  I know your dad never paid attention  even when you made CFO   Shame is that thing  And then if we can quiet it down and walk in and say   I'm going to do this   we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing  99  of the time is who  Us  Shame drives two big tapes    never good enough    and  if you can talk it out of that one   who do you think you are   The thing to understand about shame is  it's not guilt  Shame is a focus on self  guilt is a focus on behavior  Shame is  I am bad   Guilt is  I did something bad   How many of you  if you did something that was hurtful to me  would be willing to say   I'm sorry  I made a mistake   How many of you would be willing to say that  Guilt  I'm sorry  I made a mistake  Shame  I'm sorry  I am a mistake  There's a huge difference between shame and guilt  And here's what you need to know  Shame is highly  highly correlated with addiction  depression  violence  aggression  bullying  suicide  eating disorders  And here's what you even need to know more  Guilt  inversely correlated with those things  The ability to hold something we've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive  It's uncomfortable  but it's adaptive  The other thing you need to know about shame is it's absolutely organized by gender  If shame washes over me and washes over Chris  it's going to feel the same  Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame  We're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy  Which means  yes  I have a little shame  no  I'm a sociopath  So I would opt for  yes  you have a little shame  Shame feels the same for men and women  but it's organized by gender  For women  the best example I can give you is Enjoli  the commercial   I can put the wash on the line  pack the lunches  hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine  I can bring home the bacon  fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you're a man   For women  shame is  do it all  do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat  I don't know how much perfume that commercial sold  but I guarantee you  it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti anxiety meds  Shame  for women  is this web of unattainable  conflicting  competing expectations about who we're supposed to be  And it's a straight jacket  For men  shame is not a bunch of competing  conflicting expectations  Shame is one  do not be perceived as what  Weak  I did not interview men for the first four years of my study  And it wasn't until a man looked at me after a book signing  and said   I love what you have to say about shame  I'm curious why you didn't mention men   And I said   I don't study men   And he said   That's convenient   And I said   Why   And he said   Because you say to reach out  tell our story  be vulnerable  But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters   I said   Yeah    They'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down  When we reach out and be vulnerable  we get the shit beat out of us  And don't tell me it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads  Because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else   So I started interviewing men and asking questions  And what I learned is this  You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear  I'll show you a woman who's done incredible work  You show me a man who can sit with a woman who's just had it  she can't do it all anymore  and his first response is not   I unloaded the dishwasher   But he really listens   because that's all we need   I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work  Shame is an epidemic in our culture  And to get out from underneath it   to find our way back to each other  we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we're parenting  the way we're working  the way we're looking at each other  Very quickly  some research by Mahalik at Boston College  He asked  what do women need to do to conform to female norms  The top answers in this country  nice  thin  modest and use all available resources for appearance  When he asked about men  what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms  the answers were  always show emotional control  work is first  pursue status and violence  If we're going to find our way back to each other  we have to understand and know empathy  because empathy's the antidote to shame  If you put shame in a Petri dish  it needs three things to grow exponentially  secrecy  silence and judgment  If you put the same amount in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy  it can't survive  The two most powerful words when we're in struggle  me too  And so I'll leave you with this thought  If we're going to find our way back to each other  vulnerability is going to be that path  And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena  because I think I did it my whole life  and think to myself  I'm going to go in there and kick some ass when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect  And that is seductive  But the truth is  that never happens  And even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there  that's not what we want to see  We want you to go in  We want to be with you and across from you  And we just want  for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with  to dare greatly  So thank you all very much  I really appreciate it  Word count  8179
