# sortcomparator
Program that compares sort times.

## Objective
This program was made in a lab for class to demonstrate the time complexities in regards to the all the sorts we had learned at the time.

## Results
Will modify later to insert a table to display a run of data given choice A and choice B in the program, but the gist is that Merge and Quick Sort were the quickest and everything below it the slowest in terms of actually sorting data instead of sorting sorted data.

## How to run
All that needs to be done is to ```git clone``` the repo and compile as ```g++ *.cpp```. You will need to provide your own text files as ```a.txt, b.txt, & c.txt```. I will try to add functionality to allow the user to choose the text files.

## To-do
- Refactor code, it's a bit of a mess...
- Possibly make it GUI based to visually show sorts.
- Carry it over into JavaScript.
